/* Every tab must draw its own screen, and no tab but "Walk away" may draw the
   walk-away list.

   This exists because of a one-line slip that shipped: a statement dropped
   between the last `else if` of the render chain and its `else` stole that
   else, so every screen that was not out of date drew the walk-away list
   instead of itself. Nothing then in the tests noticed - they read state, or
   read the header, and the header is rendered separately from the view.

   Run it with the site served locally:
     python3 -m http.server 8099 &
     node tools/check-screens.mjs
   Playwright is not a dependency of this repo - there is no build step and
   no package.json to put it in - so it is borrowed from the global install.
   Set PW_CHROME if the browser lives somewhere else. Exits non-zero on
   failure, so it can gate a push. */
